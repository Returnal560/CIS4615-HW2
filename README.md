# CIS4615-HW2
Homework 2

For this homework, I took the 5 mandatory examples as well as 5 user selected examples of uncompliant code and made each of them be their own separate Java files. Then I uploaded the files into this repository and put them all in the main branch. Afterward, I create a branch every time I correct the code examples for a total of 10 additional branches. After merging all of the fixes into the main branch, I chose not to delete the extra 10 branches just in case these need to be looked at individually for grading.
